# Smart Contract Deployment Project

This project contains a smart contract written in Solidity and a Python script for deploying the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

```

├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is located in the `contracts` directory. It defines the properties, methods, and events necessary for the functionality of the contract.

## Deployment Script

The deployment script is located in the `scripts` directory. It handles the deployment process, including:

- Importing necessary libraries
- Connecting to the blockchain
- Compiling the smart contract
- Deploying the contract to the specified network

## Requirements

To run the deployment script, you need to install the required Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Make sure to have Python and pip installed on your machine.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Update the deployment script with your blockchain network details.
5. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   python scripts/deploy.py
   ```

## Usage

Follow the setup instructions to deploy the smart contract. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations for the blockchain network you are targeting.
